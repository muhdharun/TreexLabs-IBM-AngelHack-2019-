DISCLAIMER:

This was cloned from the IBM/MAX-Facial-Recognizer repository for the purpose of the IBM Call for Code challenge for AngelHack 2019
The code to test this API had minor edits, due to trouble in setting up some of the python libraries such as matplotlib and scipy

There are some additional pictures added into the "assets" folder for testing purposes.
